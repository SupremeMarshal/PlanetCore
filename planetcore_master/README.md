# To-the-Earth-core
A modpack for Minecraft that works with Cubic Chunk. You can dig down all the way to the Earth's core!
First, you need to install Cubic Chunks 912 and Cubic World Gen.

You also need the dependencies for Cubic Chunks.

Second, copy all the text in my preset `PlanetCore-Preset.json`. When you create a new world, go to more world options, change world type: Default to: Custom Cubic.
Then click customize, then click preset. Delete everything and copy paste my preset in the big box. Click done, and done again. Then you can create the world.

IMPORTANT: This mod needs the preset, else you will just play in a normal vanilla game. My ores only generate using the preset.

The preset does not include any of the ores I have been working on, that were not in the original mod version.
This is a fork for me to code stuff in, to show my ideas to Supreme Marshal.

NOTE: It is recommended to download Vertical Spawn Control mod [by Foghrye4]. Next, copy the `vertical_spawn_control` folder into
`%APPDATA%/Roaming/.minecraft/saves/[World name]/data`

NOTE: My mod replace all vanilla tools and armor from the game so to avoid any mobs or chest from giving vanilla tools and armor, place the `loot_tables` folder into `%APPDATA%/Roaming/.minecraft/saves/[World name]/data` too.
